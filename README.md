<h1>World Map</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This new project involved creating a comprehensive website that provides information on each country in the world.

To achieve this, I developed a scalable vector graphic (SVG) map of the world where each country highlights upon a mouse event. I then converted the SVG map into an interactive Angular component, integrating it with API services to deliver detailed information about each country. This project enhanced the user experience by providing an engaging and informative platform for exploring global geographic data.
